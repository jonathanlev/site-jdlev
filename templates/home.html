  <h1>Background</h1>
  <!-- <p>This website is the product of a global pandemic and a prolonged quarantine mandated by the federal government.
    <br>I currently a senior at the University of Vermont studying Computer Science and Information Systems.
    Here is a little about me...<br> In regards to my interests, I am intellectually fascinated by many things but in most cases science will do the trick.
    That being said music, the outdoors, and my peers tend to keep my satisfied. My </p> -->
    <p>My name is Jonathan Leventhal. I am a recent Computer Science and Information Systems graduate from the Univeristy of Vermont in beautiful Burlington, Vermont. My primary experience is in data integration, process automation, and software development.</p>
    <p>I am a creative mind looking to apply my technical fluency in customer/client facing roles. If you think I would be a good fit at your company or want to speak further, lets connect.</p>
    <p>In my four years at the University of Vermont, I found thorough enjoyment in my coursework and the process of learning and honing my technical and interpersonal skills. I have made an effort to take courses spanning the full breadth of what is offered at UVM. In my course on Evolutionary Robotics, which was particularly fascinating, my senior project was highlighted by Dr. Josh Bongard for displaying exceptional multi-objective optimization. I was also elected to lead my fraternity as Internal Vice President during my junior year and learned valuable lessons in leadership and delegation. Throughout my collegiate career, my colleagues, professors, and mentors have pointed out my exceptional ability to work with others and solve complex problems.</p>
    <p>As highlighted in my resume, I have utilized my various internship experiences to explore and learn about different industries. Beginning with my summer at Worth & Company, where I experienced working on an IT team firsthand, I came to understand the value of prudent project management and professionalism in a capacity that cannot be learned in a classroom. Subsequently, my summer with Novusmart afforded me the opportunity to learn the ins and outs of a corporate environment and gain hands on backend development experience. Most recently, my time in Chicago working on the Geographic Information Systems team at Invenergy was the culminating experience of my college years. I learned a tremendous amount about the energy industry, wind and solar in particular, and grew 10-fold as a young professional. I established myself as a highly effective team member and a fast learner, and routinely earned the trust of managers whom encouraged me to take on new tasks and spearhead new projects.</p>
